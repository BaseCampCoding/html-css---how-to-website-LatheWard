    <h1>Getting ready for your first gig</h1>
    <h2>The essentials, and things you might not have thought about</h2>
    <p>So, you've spent a few months preparing, played with your bandmates, practiced your instrument, and you're itching to get in front of some people.
        That's good, we're proud. Here's just a few tips (in no particular order) to make sure you blow them out of the water.
    </p>

<h4>First, get extras for everything that you can (mostly cables)</h4>
<p>Guitar strings, cables, drum-sticks, picks, and all of the semingly little things make a world of difference.
    Not to mention they can break at the worst moment. 
    You'll be the favorite in the group if you have spare AC cables. 
</p>

<h4>Call the manager the day before the gig to confirm</h4>
<p>Assuming you've already setup the gig date with the club owner, give him/her a call the day before to make sure nothing's come up.
    It makes you look like the professional we all know you are
</p>

<h4>Show up an hour early to setup and get a feel for the room</h4>
