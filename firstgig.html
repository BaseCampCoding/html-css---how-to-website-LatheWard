    <p>So, you've spent a few months preparing, played with your bandmates, practiced your instrument, and you're itching to get in front of some people.
        That's good, we're proud. Here's just a few tips (in no particular order) to make sure you blow them out of the water.

<h4>First, get extras for everything that you can (mostly cables)</h4>
<p>Guitar strings, cables, drum-sticks, picks, and all of the semingly little things make a world of difference.
    Not to mention they can break at the worst moment. 
    You'll be the favorite in the group if you have spare AC cables.

<h4>Call the manager the day before the gig to confirm</h4>
<p>Assuming you've already setup the gig date with the club owner, give him/her a call the day before to make sure nothing's come up.
    It makes you look like the professional we all know you are
</p>

<h4>Show up at least an hour early to setup and get a feel for the room</h4>
<p>You want to make sure you have plenty of time to see what kind of crowd you're dealing
    with, plus some time for your drummer to get ducks in a row
</p>

<div class="mt-5 mb-3 row">
<h4>Play your guts out</h4>
<p>The time has come. Show them what you're made of. Bonus points if you're good with requests.
    All the bonus points if you actually play freebird when "that guy" yells it out.

    <h5>General order of song-vibes for a good time:</h5>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
<li>Banger</li>
<li>Banger</li>
<li>Mellow out a little</li>
<li>Something soft, something intimate for the crowd</li>
<li>Get a little louder, repeat list however desired</li>
</ul>

<h4>Don't get tore up if it's not perfect</h4>
<p>Believe it or not, most musicians' first gigs are pretty bad. Really, really bad.
    Get 'em next time, champ.

<h3>Most importantly, have fun</h3>
<p>Be like Dave Grohl; Whether you're packing out a stadium, or playing to 5 people at your local pub, love what you're doing.
    If you love your music, so will they (given that you don't completely suck).
